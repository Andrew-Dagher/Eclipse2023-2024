Slide 3 – Business Needs & Goals
	•	Problem Before:
	•	Monthly reports required manual gathering from multiple sources
	•	Data analysis for specific groups/timeframes was slow
	•	Sales projections were manual, time-consuming, and required specialized knowledge
	•	Goals:
	•	Centralize data in one place
	•	Provide quick, in-depth analysis
	•	Empower stakeholders to self-serve information without relying on the reporting team

⸻

Slide 4 – Application #1: Dashboard
	•	Purpose:
	•	Centralizes monthly report data
	•	Simplifies deep analysis by integrating multiple data sources into a single interface
	•	Key Features:
	•	Real-time data retrieval
	•	Drill-down capability for in-depth metrics
	•	Filtering by region, group, product, time range
	•	Technologies:
	•	Shiny for Python
	•	SQLite database
	•	Plotly for interactive graphs

⸻

Slide 5 – Dashboard – Business Impact
	•	Before: Reports could take hours to compile
	•	After: Reports can be generated in seconds
	•	Benefits:
	•	Faster decision-making
	•	Consistent and accurate data
	•	Reduced workload for reporting team

⸻

Slide 6 – Application #2: Sales Projection Tool
	•	Purpose:
	•	Generates sales performance projections for AMG groups
	•	Allows forecasting based on historical trends
	•	Key Features:
	•	Automatic calculations for 5-year and 10-year projections
	•	Differentiates between group and segment data
	•	Ability to adjust growth rates for custom scenarios
	•	Technologies:
	•	Streamlit
	•	SQLite database
	•	Python (Pandas for data processing, Plotly for visualization)

⸻

Slide 7 – Sales Projection Tool – Business Impact
	•	Before: Projection requests had to go through the reporting team
	•	After: Stakeholders can generate their own projections
	•	Benefits:
	•	Saves time for both reporting team & stakeholders
	•	Increases agility in planning
	•	Reduces bottlenecks

⸻

Slide 8 – How They Work (High-Level)
	•	Data Flow:
	1.	Data is extracted from internal databases / files
	2.	Stored in a local SQLite database
	3.	Applications query & process the data
	4.	Visualizations and tables are generated in real time
	•	Security/Access:
	•	Internal hosting
	•	Access restricted to authorized users

⸻

Slide 9 – Results & Feedback
	•	Outcomes:
	•	Reduced manual reporting time by X%
	•	Enabled self-service analytics for stakeholders
	•	Improved accuracy and timeliness of reports
	•	Feedback:
	•	Positive reception from team & managers
	•	Requests for additional features (e.g., export options, predictive analytics)

⸻

Slide 10 – Future Improvements
	•	Dashboard:
	•	Expand data sources
	•	Add automated scheduled reports
	•	Projection Tool:
	•	Incorporate more advanced forecasting models
	•	Allow multiple scenario comparisons
	•	General:
	•	Cloud deployment for wider accessibility
	•	Training sessions for stakeholders

⸻

Slide 11 – Quick Demo
	•	Plan:
	•	3 minutes for Dashboard demo
	•	3 minutes for Projection Tool demo

⸻

Slide 12 – Conclusion
	•	Summary:
	•	Both tools reduce manual work & speed up decision-making
	•	Empower stakeholders with self-service capabilities
	•	Strong foundation for future analytics initiatives
	•	Thank you
	•	Questions
